# Diabetic-Food-Diary-App

## The concept

**Do you know what standard portion sizes look like?** 

Unless you measure your meals, chances are youâ€™re logging inaccurate portion sizes. This app is designed to take the guesswork out of tracking your meals, and gives you a more accurate sense of your intake, by allowing you to take pictures of your meals and share them with your diabetic dietician, so that everyone has a better idea of why your blood sugars are behaving the way they are. Just snap a photo on the spot or pick one from your library, add a few details, and save the photo into your diary to see exactly what you ate and when. 

## The research

At the moment there a few apps that allow you to create a food diary, however not many of them are aimed at diabetics with the aim of helping them maintain their blood sugar.
