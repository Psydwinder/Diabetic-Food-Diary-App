# Diabetic-Food-Diary-App

## The concept

**Do you know what standard portion sizes look like?** 

Unless you measure your meals, chances are youâ€™re logging inaccurate portion sizes. This app is designed to take the guesswork out of tracking your meals, and gives you a more accurate sense of your intake, by allowing you to take pictures of your meals and share them with your diabetic dietician, so that everyone has a better idea of why your blood sugars are behaving the way they are. Just snap a photo on the spot or pick one from your library, add a few details, and save the photo into your diary to see exactly what you ate and when. 

## The research

At the moment there a few apps that allow you to create a food diary, however not many of them are aimed at diabetics with the aim of helping them maintain their blood sugar. 

Some notable apps are:

- Figwee Visual Food Diary (Android) - This app is no longer available on newer devices as it was made for older versions of android.
- Your Food (Android & iOS) - Your Food Journal offers tips and insights as you keep logging what you eat to help you make more informed decisions each day. It can:

    - Help easily track your meals and water each day
    - Log journal entries and help set goals as you better plan ahead
    - See insights as you log your meals and water to help you make decisions
    - Get notifications throughout the day
    
- Carb Manager (Android & iOS) -
